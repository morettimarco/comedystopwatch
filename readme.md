# Stand-up Comedy Timer PWA

This Progressive Web App was born out of the frustration of not finding a reliable timer specifically designed for stand-up comedy sets. Traditional timers often fall short of meeting the unique demands of live performance, which led to the creation of this project.

## Why This App?

During numerous performances, I experienced the shortcomings of generic timers:
- **Silent Alerts:** Traditional timers often make loud noises when time is up, disrupting the flow of a set. This app uses subtle visual and haptic cues instead.
- **Screen Activity:** Conventional timers let your device sleep, risking missed cues. This app actively keeps the screen awake during the countdown.
- **Easy Glanceability:** In the middle of a performance, you need to quickly check the remaining time without breaking your focus. The large, clear display makes that possible.
- **High Visibility When Time’s Up:** When the time expires, the app employs bold visual alerts (like blinking effects) to ensure the signal is visible from a distance.

## Features

- **PWA Functionality:**  
  Enjoy an app-like experience with offline capabilities and easy installation on your device.
  
- **Dynamic Countdown Timer:**  
  Set custom durations using minute and second inputs.

- **Full-Round Visual Progress Indicator:**  
  A conic-gradient progress bar offers an at-a-glance understanding of the remaining time.

- **Haptic Feedback:**  
  Uses device vibration for a subtle alert when time’s up (on supported devices).

- **Screen Wake Lock:**  
  Prevents the device from going to sleep during the countdown.
